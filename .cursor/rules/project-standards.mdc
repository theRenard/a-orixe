# a-orixe project standards

- Prefer project conventions defined in **CLAUDE.md** (tech stack, style, commands).
- Follow patterns already used in the codebase; avoid introducing new styles without reason.
- Keep changes focused; one concern per commit or change set when possible.
- When adding dependencies or scripts, document them in README or CLAUDE.md.
- When adding a new section to the long page, add it at the end: register the component last in `HomeView.vue` (and in the mobile view if applicable) so the section appears at the bottom of the scroll.
